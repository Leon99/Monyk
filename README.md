# Monyk

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/monyk/Monyk/_apis/build/status/Leon99.Monyk?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/monyk/Monyk/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

## Overview

### What is this?

It's a distributed reliability monitoring tool that can be operated without learning rocket science.
It's like UptimeRobot, only open-source, extensible, self-hosted, cross-platform, RESTful, DevOps-friendly and cost-efficient.

### What exactly can it do?

At the moment, it can check HTTP(S) endpoints and ping hosts from multiple locations.
Alerts can be posted via WebHook (e.g. via Slack).

### Anything else I need to know before trying it?

Monyk consist of the following loosely-coupled components:

1. *GroundControl* allows you to specify *monitors* via its REST API and takes care of triggering the *checks* according to the specifications.
2. *Probes* actually perform the checks. You may want to put many of those around the globe - it's optimized for minimal resource consumption.
3. *Lab* allows you to configure *actions* to be performed on receiving check results via its REST API and processes the results of the checks.

### OK how do I use it?

This section covers launching Monyk using default setting for development environment:

- databases re-created on start-up
- mock data initially added to the databases to help kick-start things
- *GroundControl* API is accessible from browser via https://localhost:42113/swagger
- *Lab* API is accessible from browser via https://localhost:42133/swagger

See [Details](#Details) section for details on preparing it to run in the wild.

Note that all the further commands assume that you have cloned the repository:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/leon99/monyk
cd monyk
```

#### Run/debug using Visual Studio

1. Run `docker-compose -f .\docker-compose-infra-only.yml up` to launch just the required infrastructure.
2. Use [SwitchStartupProject](https://bitbucket.org/thirteen/switchstartupproject/) to launch all the Monyk components from VS at once. An appropriate config file for it is included here.

#### Run using Docker Compose

`docker-compose up`

#### Run manually

1. [Install RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
2. Make sure that you have the latest release of [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed
3. Run *GroundControl*: `dotnet run --project src/Monyk.GroundControl.Main`
4. Run *Probes*: `dotnet run --project src/Monyk.Lab.Main`
5. Run *Lab*: `dotnet run --project src/Monyk.Probe.Main`
6. (Optional) [Install Seq](https://docs.getseq.net/docs/getting-started-with-docker) to make use of semantic logging support


#### Hold on, but you said there will be no rocket science?

## Details

### Installation

Using Docker images ([leon99/monyk-groundcontrol](https://hub.docker.com/r/leon99/monyk-groundcontrol), [leon99/monyk-probe](https://hub.docker.com/r/leon99/monyk-probe), [leon99/monyk-lab](https://hub.docker.com/r/leon99/monyk-lab)) is the recommended way to run Monyk in non-development environments.

### Configuration

Configuration can be done using any of the following methods (in order of priority, starting with the highest):

1. Command line parameters
2. Environment variables
3. Using `appsettings.<environment>.yml`, when `<environment>` can be specified using `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable

Check `appsettings-reference.yml` for the reference on available settings.

When configuring using environment variables, use `MONYK_` prefix and `__` as a delimiter in hierarchical keys. Examples can be found in `docker-compose.override.yml`.

### Recipes

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) with [REST API Provider](https://github.com/Mastercard/terraform-provider-restapi) can be used to manage Monyk as part of an infrastructure-as-a-code solution.
